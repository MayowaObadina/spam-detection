# spam-detection
The main goal of this project is to create a Natural Language Processing (NLP)- based system using Large Language Model (LLM) to identify spam emails. It aims to analyze emailâ€™s content not only by checking the spamming key examples, but by revealing manipulative strategies used by spammers.
