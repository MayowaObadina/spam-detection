chevrontexaco corp . is backing dynegy inc . ' s proposed buyout of ailing enron corp . by putting $ 2 . 5 billion of new equity in dynegy to support the deal . chevrontexaco ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 our relationship with dynegy has proven to be highly beneficial for both companies ,,,,, power and coal ,,,,,,,,,
 we are also hopeful that the combination of dynegy and enron will restore market and credit confidence in this important energy sector ,,,,, and the company would restate four years worth of filings the company ' s stock price plunged from a 52 - week peak of $ 84 . 87 to $ 7 two weeks ago . shell was reported at one time to be a potential buyer of enron .,,,,,,,,,

enron meltdown storage was chock - full ,,,,, because the winter would have to be 7 - 8 % colder than normal just to burn up the 375 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) surplus already in storage ,,,,,,,,,
in face of all those bearish facts ,,,,, either,,,,,,,,,
no ,,,,, but there was not much chance to profit by this . storage was so full that little volume could have been injected during october .,,,,,,,,,
"so if someone says the price surge that month was all due to """" the expected workings of supply and demand ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a better idea emerges after we note that spot prices continued high into november ,,,,, and then became fact . by presstime last wednesday ,,,,,,,,,
we think it likely that the reason prices were not that low in october is that with rumors of enron troubles circulating ,,,,," and whose ability to obtain those supplies via futures or swaps was eroded because its credit was on the verge of being downgraded to junk ? """" an energy banker asked . this could have favored the long side of the market",,,,,,,,,
in normal circumstances ,,,,, since they trade often with enron . commercial players might have perceived them as being infected with some of the same weakness .,,,,,,,,,
after the dynegy deal was announced ,,,,, with cash prices more than $ 1 below where they were during bid week , that points to a correlation of falling prices and a revived enron . they don ' t speak german at enron , do they ?,,,,,,,
if so ,,,,," the germans """" stacked """" all their contracts covering their oil needs for the coming year as long positions on the near month . they would go to delivery on just the portion they needed for the next four weeks ", the prompt month usually is higher than the next one . so the germans thought they had a strategy that would guarantee them a profit every month when they flipped their futures stack , a nice kicker on top of having locked in the underlying cost of the oil they would use for the year . yeah , right . well , one month that didn ' t happen , mostly because other traders got wind of what the germans were doing and decided to hold their feet to the fire by bidding up the next month ( which is a variant of what happened to long term capital management four years later . ) so , losing another battle of the bulge , this time to nymex traders instead of to general patton , metallgesellschaft cratered . as a trustee unwound the train wreck of long futures , he went on a selling spree that kept the nymex price low for months .

debt owed by osprey trust , and $ 915 million owed by marlin water
trust , the company said in the filing .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 19 ( reuters ) - several states that delayed plans to deregulate power markets were scared off by the woes of beleaguered energy trader enron corp . , california ' s failed electricity market restructuring , and the sept . 11 attacks , the head of potomac electric power co . said on monday .
john derrick , chief executive of washington - based pepco , said in an interview , while utility deregulation will eventually regain momentum , uncertainty in the market has left some states questioning the effectiveness of any near - term change to the volatile power market .
several states have delayed power deregulation , including nevada , oregon , new mexico , oklahoma , arkansas , west virginia and montana .
"" all things that are happening to the margin , whether it be california , 9 - 11 ( the sept . 11 attacks ) , or enron , will tend to slow down changes that have gone down that path , "" derrick said after addressing an energy department conference here on coal technology .
derrick was optimistic about the future of deregulation . "" where it already exists , it ' s working , and i think we ' ll stay the course , "" he said .
to boost customer choice , 23 states and the district columbia have deregulated retail electricity markets . deregulation breaks up utility monopolies , giving customers a choice of providers and driving down prices .
electricity competition is set to begin in texas , illinois , michigan , and virginia next year .
derrick said state deregulation efforts will pick up momentum if consumers demand more choice and lower prices .
"" people who ( live in a market that is deregulated ) , and move to a place where it doesn ' t exist , are going to say ' gee , why can ' t i have it here ' , "" derrick said .
"" customers are going to start to demand choice , "" he added .
pepco is part of the pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland ( pjm ) power pool , which operates the electricity grid in the mid - atlantic region . pjm , which currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of more than 59 , 000 megawatts , plans to expand generating capacity by 25 percent in the next few years to meet demand .
pjm also operates a wholesale electricity market with more than 200 buyers , sellers and traders .
california dealt the first blow to electricity deregulation last year , when state power prices soared , bankrupting pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric unit , and forcing rolling blackouts to some customers .
experts have blamed the california power crisis on the state ' s ill - fated deregulation plan , which prohibited utilities from passing on wholesale price increases to consumers .
the decline of enron may slow restructuring because uncertain customers will stick with existing power suppliers rather than seek new energy providers .

new york - - some pension funds with major stakes in enron corp . are considering taking legal action against the houston energy giant following its recent stock collapse and disclosures of possible conflicts of interest among management .
other institutional investors are taking a more passive approach , waiting to see how developments unfold .
among those pension funds looking into possible lawsuits are the $ 112 billion new york state common retirement fund and the five new york city pension funds , which handle a total of $ 85 billion in assets for the city ' s firefighters , police , teachers and other workers . the state fund holds about 2 . 1 million enron ( ene ) shares and the city funds hold about 2 . 9 million .
"" we ' re looking at a possible lawsuit , but we ' re not leaning one way or another , "" said frank sobrino , spokesman for the new york state common retirement fund .
"" we ' re looking into [ possible legal action ] , but nothing ' s been decided yet , "" said david neustadt , spokesman for the new york city comptroller ' s office , which oversees the city ' s five pension funds .
barclays global investors , which manages about $ 790 billion , mostly for pension funds and other institutional clients , said it would join others in a class - action suit , but wouldn ' t be the lead plaintiff . barclays is the fourth - largest investor in enron , with about 21 million shares as of sept . 30 .
"" our style doesn ' t lend itself to taking that lead role , but we would be members of a class suit , "" said linda selbach , head of corporate governance . as primarily a passive money manager , barclays invests according to market forces , not according to company information , and so couldn ' t claim to have been misled by false information , she explained .
however , "" on the macro level , we ' ve been very involved in the shaping of the law with respect to securities litigation , and would be again , "" she said . the company would be especially inclined to get involved if the suit promised to set a precedent for other cases further down the line , she said .
pension funds among largest enron investors
institutional investors such as pension funds , mutual fund companies and money management firms are among the largest investors in enron , once a top - performing company whose stock has plunged 89 % year - to - date and is now the subject of a securities and exchange commission probe into outside partnership deals . several law firms already have sued the company on behalf of shareholders , accusing enron of misleading investors and artificially inflating its share price .
last week , the $ 143 billion california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers , issued a release stating their intention to oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of any company with which enron may be contemplating a merger .
the statement came following reports that enron might be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . ( dyn ) , and that enron was seeking the right to appoint three members to the combined company board .
"" until all of these issues are sorted out , the interests of shareholders are best served by retirement of all the current directors , "" michael flaherman , chair of calpers ' investment committee , said in the statement .
however , calpers has no comment regarding possible legal action against enron , spokesman brad pacheco said .
calpers owns about three million shares of enron and also invests in dynegy .
the $ 105 billion california state teachers retirement system , or calstrs , is "" taking a keen interest , and reviewing our holdings and options "" regarding enron , said a spokeswoman . the board has made no decisions yet , but plans to discuss the subject in a closed session at the next board meeting , she said .
the $ 96 billion florida retirement system , which holds 9 . 7 million enron shares , is "" still evaluating the situation , "" spokeswoman lee baldwin said . "" our feeling is that there ' s so much news going on , and the decision is so far off , that we ' re waiting to see what will happen . ""
similarly , among mutual fund companies , janus capital corp . , the second - largest holder of enron with 41 . 4 million shares as of sept . 30 , is not yet considering legal action , as a spokeswoman said it would be premature .
alliance capital management lp , the largest holder of enron with 42 . 9 million shares as of sept . 30 , and fidelity management & research , the fifth - largest holder with 20 . 8 million shares as of sept . 30 , said that they have policies of not commenting on individual company holdings . the largest actively managed u . s . mutual fund , the $ 71 . 6 billion fidelity magellan fund , held 5 . 7 million shares of enron as of sept . 30 , according to a semiannual report released last week .

usa : update 2 - congressman urges probe of andersen on enron .
by kevin drawbaugh
11 / 19 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 19 ( reuters ) - a u . s . congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen llp in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released on monday .
turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john dingell asked the public oversight board for "" an oversight review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , "" said the letter made available to reuters .
dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 .
"" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , "" wrote dingell , a michigan democrat , in the letter .
"" i request that pob ' s investigation or review include adequate , transparent and public disclosure of all significant issues identified , "" dingell wrote .
as accounting has consolidated into fewer and larger firms with more lines of business from auditing to consulting , it has come under increasing fire on the conflict - of - interest issue . the dingell letter is only the latest in a continuing barrage of criticism leveled in recent years at big five firms .
arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of certain outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending . enron earlier this month said it planned to be bought out by rival dynegy inc . .
critics have said arthur andersen should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to its unusual finances . a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged arthur andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it was collecting from enron while it was also being paid as auditor .
andersen says confident in process
responding to dingell , andersen spokesman david tabolt said accounting firms must report litigation involving allegations of audit failures within 30 days to a committee of the sec ' s practice section , which the public oversight board oversees .
"" under the profession ' s self - regulatory processes , which the pob oversees , the committee is responsible for conducting an inquiry to determine whether the matters that are the subject of litigation indicate systemic quality control problems that need to be addressed either by the firm involved or by the profession , "" tabolt said .
"" we are confident that this process will confirm the quality of our auditing processes , "" he said .
after the sec said last month that it was investigating enron , the company appointed a special internal committee to look into the unusual partnership deals at the heart of the probe . deloitte & touche , also a big five accounting firm , was named to assist the committee in its inquiry , enron said .
but , according to dingell , deloitte is conducting a triennial peer review of andersen under a system set up in the 1970 s to ensure quality accounting . the peer review process is also supervised by the public oversight board , based in connecticut . neither the board nor deloitte could be reached .
dingell said deloitte ' s dual roles as peer reviewer of andersen and as internal investigator of its audit client enron raise further questions of potential conflicts of interest .
"" given the appearance of conflicts of interest , the public record to date regarding allegations of professional malpractice or worse by andersen in both the waste management fraud and the evolving enron corp . accounting debacle , as well as the considerable damage to investors , there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , "" wrote dingell , ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce .
in june , arthur andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , a garbage hauling concern , in the largest ever civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

enron delays closing indian plant after creditors ' legal action

afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
bombay ( afx ) - enron corp ' s indian subsidiary said it had to delay serving a final termination notice to close its power project in western maharashtra state after local creditors filed legal action .
the dabhol power company ltd ( dpc ) was originally going to serve the notice to maharashtra state ' s electricity board ( mseb ) after today , when the six - month deadline for resolving a payment dispute ends , an enron official told agence france - presse .
now , however , it has to wait until after dec 3 , because indian banks and financial institutions that have lent money to dabhol power recently filed a lawsuit to ensure they get their funds back .
"" the domestic lenders have gone to the court and secured a stay order against our final notice till their next nearing which is on december 3 , "" an enron official said .
"" we are working on a strategy to help resolve the issue as soon as possible , but obviously can ' t disclose it now . ""
the lawsuit was filed by the state bank of india , icici ltd , the industrial development bank of india and ifci ltd .
the enron official said the bankers have gone to court demanding an immediate resumption of work at the plant to ensure cash flow and to help the owners repay money owed to the lenders .

country briefing
from the economist
new york : lawyers are swarming all over enron ' s old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation . more than 20 class - action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks , and new ones are popping up every day . a formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in houston , where the troubled energy company is based , with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by december 21 st .
the broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement , legal ways of saying that the company ' s financial statements were garbage . this week , enron ' s founder and chairman , kenneth lay , decided to forgo a severance package worth over $ 60 m while admitting that the company ' s problems "" had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital , both on and off the balance sheet "" . america ' s financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) is looking again at off - balance - sheet financing , having fretted about it on and off for a decade .
there will also be charges of insider trading , because even as enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports , top executives were dumping over $ 1 billion of enron shares to "" unsuspecting investors "" , a group that includes anybody who , however briefly , has held one of the company ' s 750 m shares in the past two years . "" the number of class members will be huge , "" says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim .
there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone .
because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ?
source : the economist .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones another $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity that lay said was in negotiations last week ; and the success of a planned $ 800 million sale of assets by year ' s end ) .
the $ 1 . 75 billion loan is part of a $ 3 billion revolving facility , also led by jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb , that was drawn down in october to pay off about $ 1 . 8 billion in commercial paper obligations and calm the market ' s concerns about enron ' s liquidity . the facility also includes a $ 1 . 25 billion portion that matures in 2005 .
"" one of the big credit issues from a corporate standpoint is enron ' s ability to renew the 364 - day facility that matures in 2002 , "" said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst at fitch .
the lead banks declined to comment on the ongoing loan discussions , which include the already agreed to $ 1 billion facility that is secured by enron pipeline assets , and other bankers in the close - knit loan syndication community admitted to being in the dark .
it is likely , though , that the discussions have included an attempt to address bankers ' concerns about the loan maturing in five months , pellecchia said .
"" i think that in conjunction with the new $ 1 billion loan , they are attempting to address the revolver , "" pellecchia said .
the $ 1 billion loan , hammered out in late october , was expected to be syndicated among a small , select group of lenders . incorporating the maturing revolver into the current solution would likely bring in a wider circle of banks , one banker said , noting that "" just about everybody was in that [ existing ] deal . ""
jpm / citi must save enron
however the financing unfolds , arrangers jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb ' s tight control of the deal reflects the banks ' urgency in aiding a major corporate client to which they have a broad range of business exposure . that exposure extends beyond corporate loans to credit derivatives and short - term loans financing the company ' s myriad energy trading - related transactions .
"" [ jp morgan and citi ] have the most to gain but also the most to lose with respect to enron , "" said one rival banker , adding that the banks ' rapid response to enron ' s deteriorating situation reflected the importance of those relationships . "" i was amazed how quickly that [ $ 1 billion ] deal came together , and how enron - which never did anything secured - pledged its most valuable [ pipeline ] assets . ""
the $ 1 billion loan is secured by enron ' s trans western and northern natural gas pipeline systems , the latter of which is also pledged to dynegy for its $ 1 . 5 billion investment .
"" from a risk standpoint , it ' s probably the best peace of enron paper that chase and citi have - it ' s the only secured stuff out there , "" said one banker . but despite the impressive collateral , the $ 1 billion loan was priced attractively at 250 basis points over libor , he said . "" i think it ' s a comment on how bad the news was . enron ' s going to have to put up one of its major jewels for a $ 1 billion credit at libor plus 250 . ""
in addition to playing major roles in financing enron ' s off - balance sheet ventures , such as the dahbol power project in india , jp morgan chase and citibank / ssb have also been major players in the company ' s complicated financing initiatives . for example , citibank / ssb runs enron ' s yosemite credit - linked note program and , along with jp morgan chase , is active in other enron - related credit derivative business .
a recent research report by goldman sachs noted that the one - stop shop concept closely tied the banks to enron and has also made them crucial in these trying times .
"" the two banks most involved with enron in terms of magnitude of credit / derivatives exposure , citi and jp morgan , were also obviously involved in selling the company , with each acting as a financial advisor in the sale , "" the report stated . "" the banks were critical ( given enron ' s liquidity needs and the related high risk to further rating agency downgrades ) and likely influential to the outcome reached to sell the company as a means to sustain the operations of enron and protect all creditors involved . consequently , in a way , this is another win for the bank / broker model , "" the report says .
in a separate report , goldman ' s fixed income power analyst , robert rubin , said that despite enron ' s questionable business practices bringing it close to the brink , a merger that maintains its core energy market - making operations is preferable to leaving a vacuum in that arena . he added that despite concerns raised by the ratings agencies and other parties , goldman believes the merger will close .
"" the balance sheet of a combined company could be strong , if enron completes its asset sales , "" fitch ' s pellecchia said . "" but there are still a lot of moving pieces . ""

the complaint charges enron corp . and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 . the complaint alleges that during the class period , the defendants engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates and interested parties , which disguised enron ' s true financial position . many of the details of these transactions were hidden from the public . defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve enron ' s balance sheet , thereby maintaining enron shares at an artificially inflated price . certain enron executives , who held positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of interest , reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these transactions .
the complaint further alleges that during the class period , defendants made misleading statements regarding the potential value of enron ' s broadband business , in order to artificially boost enron ' s share price . with knowledge that enron ' s broadband business would never post a profit and was seriously overvalued , defendants continued to make misleading statements about the broadband business in order to maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels . defendants used the artificially inflated value of enron ' s broadband business in order to gain millions of dollars in financing . defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing arrangements . defendants hid the true nature of enron ' s earnings , its hedging , its businesses , and the correct state of enron ' s finances from its investors and the market , further artificially inflating enron ' s share price . while the stock was artificially inflated for the above reasons , enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining personal proceeds of more than $ 482 million during the class period , before the public became aware of the above practices .

2. **Attachment**: The presence of an attachment, especially with a file extension like .xls, could be suspicious if unexpected, as attachments can sometimes contain malware.

3. **Sender and Relationship**: If the sender is known and the recipient is expecting this type of communication, it could be ""ham."" If the sender is unknown or the recipient is not expecting this, it could be ""spam.""

4. **Language and Tone**: The email lacks a personal touch or detailed context, which is often a characteristic of spam.

Without additional context about the sender or the recipient's expectations, it's challenging to definitively classify this email. However, given the generic nature and the presence of an attachment, it leans more towards ""spam."" 

If the recipient is not expecting this email or does not recognize the sender, it should be treated with caution and considered ""spam."" If it is from a known and trusted source, it could be ""ham.""",,,,,,,,

The email appears to be a simple notification about an attachment, specifically an Excel file named ""hplo 616 . xls,"" which seems to be related to an ""hpl nom for june 16, 2000."" Without additional context, such as the sender's identity or the recipient's relationship to the sender, it's challenging to definitively classify this email. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Spam Indicators**: 
   - If the email is from an unknown or suspicious sender, it could be spam.
   - If the recipient was not expecting such an email or does not recognize the context, it could be spam.
   - The presence of an unsolicited attachment can be a red flag for spam or phishing attempts.

2. **Ham Indicators**:
   - If the email is from a known and trusted sender, it is more likely to be ham.
   - If the recipient was expecting the attachment or is familiar with the context (e.g., related to work or a specific project), it is more likely to be ham.

Given the limited information, if the email is from a known and trusted source and the recipient was expecting the attachment, it would be classified as ""ham."" If the email is unsolicited, from an unknown sender, or the recipient has no context for the attachment, it would be safer to classify it as ""spam.""

Without additional context, I would advise caution and suggest classifying it as ""spam"" until the sender's legitimacy and the email's purpose can be verified.",,,,,,,,

what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included ,,,,, except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .,,,,,,,,,
why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history ,,,,, defaults could spread through the system ,,,,,,,,,

dynegy ' s interest in enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its houston - based neighbour ' s position as the number - one natural gas and power marketer in the us .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the potential is staggering . if the companies combined ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all ,,,,, ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .,,,,,,,,,
many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it became a new age holding company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would go to the open market and purchase electricity ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . """" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices ,,,,, my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation ,,,,,,,,,

enron ,,,,, customers and regulators following last month ' s ill - explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn ( # 820 m ) to meet off - balance - sheet obligations .,,,,,,,,,

enron said it believed mr fastow ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the group said it and its auditors had also decided some off - balance entities should have been included in its prior financial statements .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is hardly surprising that talks with dynegy about a capital injection have dragged on . would it really be wise for dynegy to take on risk that remains very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy ? enron might look cheap ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

enron ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with enron about an acquisition ,,,,," """" said brian youngberg ",,,,,,,,,
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one question is whether a dynegy acquisition of enron would face a drawn - out regulatory and antitrust review that could block enron ' s chances of recovering .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the dynegy deal is approved ,,,,, but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 ,,,,,,,,,
enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades ,,,,, far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices ,,,,,,,,,
energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plank said traders """" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . """" not everyone has been able to do it . """" but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if enron ' s bond rating crashes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

enron corp . on thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the action was designed to clear nagging questions about the houston - based energy concern ' s finances stemming from a series of controversial partnerships . those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of enron shares and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with rival dynegy inc .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both companies confirmed merger talks thursday . some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron also said that it fired ben glisan ,,,,, enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .,,,,,,,,,
the restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationship between several senior enron executives and a series of partnerships created by the energy concern .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in essence ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents """" should not be relied upon . """"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share ,,,,, would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front ,,,,,,,,,
dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset ,,,,, head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities .,,,,,,,,,

investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : well ,,,,, that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it .,,,,,,
velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dynegy ' s interest in enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its houston - based neighbour ' s position as the number - one natural gas and power marketer in the us .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the potential is staggering . if the companies combined ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all ,,,,, ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .,,,,,,,,,
many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it became a new age holding company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would go to the open market and purchase electricity ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . """" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices ,,,,, my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation ,,,,,,,,,

it is hardly surprising that talks with dynegy about a capital injection have dragged on . would it really be wise for dynegy to take on risk that remains very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy ? enron might look cheap ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

energy trading giant enron corp . disclosed yesterday that it had overstated its earnings by $ 567 million since 1997 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s stock has plummeted and energy companies have avoided doing business with it since enron disclosed last month that its obligations to several partnerships involving company officials had reduced its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . enron is facing a cash crunch ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with enron about an acquisition ,,,,," """" said brian youngberg ",,,,,,,,,
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one question is whether a dynegy acquisition of enron would face a drawn - out regulatory and antitrust review that could block enron ' s chances of recovering .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the dynegy deal is approved ,,,,, but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 ,,,,,,,,,
enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades ,,,,, far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices ,,,,,,,,,
energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plank said traders """" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] .

enron corp . on thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four years ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the action was designed to clear nagging questions about the houston - based energy concern ' s finances stemming from a series of controversial partnerships . those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of enron shares and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with rival dynegy inc .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both companies confirmed merger talks thursday . some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron also said that it fired ben glisan ,,,,, enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .,,,,,,,,,
the restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationship between several senior enron executives and a series of partnerships created by the energy concern .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in essence ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents """" should not be relied upon . """"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron and dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in the u . s . ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on the topic ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

katayama : enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
andre meade ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : enron stock slumped further and dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) rose on the news . investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
( end videotape ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
velshi : fred ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : right . you know ,,,,, down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october .,,,,,,,,,
velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : well ,,,,, that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it .,,,,,,
velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is ,,,,, human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies .,,,,,,,,,

houston ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with u . s . securities and exchange commission .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $ 690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week . that marked the start of a nine - day period that expires on nov . 26 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if not ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share . the move reflects adjustments made after the quarter ' s end ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on oct . 16 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $ 3 . 9 billion to other partnerships ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and """" would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron had released those figures earlier ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
credit could be a killer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to """" baa 3 """" and """" bbb - minus ",,,,," """" a junk rating .",,,,,,,,,
in nearly all of its partnership deals ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc .

enron corp . warned that continuing credit worries , a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth - quarter earnings .
the energy company said it may be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships . the partnership , whitewing llp , held assets with a book value of $ 4 . 7 billion on nov . 16 but a drop in the value of enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $ 700 million , the company said .
in addition , enron , houston , said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $ 690 million note . that note became a "" demand obligation , "" on nov . 12 , when enron ' s credit rating got lowered to triple - b - minus by standard & poor ' s . the company didn ' t disclose who holds the note .
"" we ' ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets , "" said company spokesman mark palmer . one of the assets includes c . e . g . rio , a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction . the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash .
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and , in some cases , to keep debt off its balance sheet . in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct . 31 , the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet .
the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc . but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov . 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening . the petition alleges that enron ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron ' s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron . enron said it would vigorously defend itself .
yesterday ' s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses . in its original third - quarter statement , the company reported a loss of $ 618 million . the stated loss was increased to $ 635 million last week and in the latest filing , the loss for the quarter ended sept . 30 was widened to $ 664 million .
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren ' t necessarily final because its external auditor , arthur andersen , hasn ' t completed its review , nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm ' s accounting practices .

senior wall street bankers are concerned that dynegy could walk away from its proposed $ 9 . 8 bn ( # 6 . 8 bn ) rescue bid for its rival energy group enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets .
in a series of interviews with the financial times , bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for dynegy to pull out , some of the company ' s shareholders were under the impression that the "" material adverse change "" clause could be triggered .
"" there is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen , or even likely to happen , "" one banker said . "" and the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good , "" he added . none of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified .
the possibility of dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from jp morgan chase and citigroup , which are advising enron , met with officials from moody ' s , the credit rating agencies , 10 days ago .
the rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for dynegy to give up its bid , further undermining enron ' s creditworthiness .
moody ' s decision to preserve enron ' s investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid .
in justifying the all - stock bid , chuck watson , chairman of dynegy , said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of enron ' s market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure .
but he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with moody ' s had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose .
according to dynegy , the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron ' s finances , possible litigation against the energy company , balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts . www . ft . com / enron .

enron drops earnings for 3 rd quarter
$ 690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
enron corp . ' s financial well - being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday .
in a securities and exchange commission filing , enron said it reduced third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors .
the company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .
the revelations came in the embattled energy trader ' s 10 - q document , which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet . enron delayed releasing the 10 - q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm , andersen , because of an ongoing investigation by the company ' s board of directors and the need for more time .
"" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , "" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of enron ' s special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron ' s pending $ 690 million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil . one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb - on rating agency standard & poor ' s scale , which it did nov . 12 . if enron doesn ' t put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it , the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership ' s assets .
enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
if enron ' s debt rating continues to drop , which would put it below investment grade , the company would face another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments , the company said in the filing , mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years : $ 2 . 4 billion owed by osprey trust and $ 915 million by marlin water trust .
enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies , but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $ 500 million to $ 1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat .
the turmoil around enron ' s finances started after oct . 16 , when steep losses in its third - quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company ' s board of directors .
the ljm partnerships were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company ' s new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company ' s stock .
the cfo ' s dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an sec investigation as well as an internal enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1 / 2 years by nearly $ 600 million .
those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in enron , which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating . the company eventually reached a deal with rival dynegy to be acquired for almost $ 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock .
the fallout from enron ' s crumble is spreading to its major service providers , including andersen . that firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit , while on monday rep . john dingell , d - mich . , called for an investigation of andersen in connection with its audits of enron and houston - based waste management .
"" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , "" dingell wrote in a letter to the public oversight board requesting the investigation .
andersen , based in chicago , has a large houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients , including enron and dynegy . critics of andersen have said the firm should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to the company ' s unusual finances .
a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from enron while it was auditor .
in june , andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , the largest civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

enron corp . warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $ 690 - million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third - quarter earnings .
the energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $ 690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships .
if the debt isn ' t paid , the partner could liquidate the partnership ' s assets , which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
enron has already used up its $ 3 - billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash .
the company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share , according to its filing with the securities and exchange commission . that would put its loss at 87 cents a share .

a congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released monday .
turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john d . dingell ( d - mich . ) asked the public oversight board for a "" review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , "" said the letter .
dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 .
arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending .

u . s . official calls for probe of andersen , 2 problem audits

washington - - concerned about the accounting profession ' s ability to police itself , a senior house of representatives democrat has called for a "" special investigation "" of arthur andersen llp and its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc .
in a letter to u . s . public oversight board chairman charles bowsher released monday , rep . john dingell , a michigan democrat , requested a review of andersen ' s audits of enron and waste management , two high - profile audit failures .
enron , of houston , which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival dynergy inc . , acknowledged it overstated net income by $ 586 million ( 662 . 5 million euros ) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997 .
the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating enron ' s treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ' s problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for andersen . in june , the firm reached a $ 7 million settlement with the sec in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of waste management .
andersen and the waste hauler paid $ 220 million in 1999 to settle class - action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated waste management ' s reported earnings in the mid - 1990 s .
in addition to the sec ' s probe of its role in the enron matter , andersen is undergoing routine peer review by deloitte & touche . dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that deloitte & touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of enron ' s board of directors .
given the potential conflict of interest on the part of deloitte & touche , and andersen ' s track record , "" there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , "" mr . dingell wrote .

passing up
some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages .
last week , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay decided to forgo a $ 60 . 6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of the houston energy trader . enron initially said mr . lay would keep one - third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company . he later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders , who produce most of enron ' s profits .
"" in this environment , we ' re seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance , "" says ira kay , executive - compensation practice leader of pay - and - benefits consultants watson wyatt worldwide in new york .
alan johnson , managing director of new york pay consultants johnson associates , says mr . lay ' s initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "" the continuing trend of executives being clueless . ""
( for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million from exercising enron stock options , according to disclosure reports tracked by thomson financial . )
three top executives of us airways group inc . , including chief executive rakesh gangwal and chairman stephen wolf , passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through . the trio stood to gain $ 45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now - defunct merger accord with ual corp . at us airways ' sept . 19 annual meeting , they said they would remain with the company .
firm relationship
new york law firm cadwalader , wickersham & taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first - year associates .
for two hours a month for at least a year , each associate will meet with a designated mentor - - typically a midlevel associate - - to discuss issues such as career development . if the relationship doesn ' t click , new pairings will be made . cwt hires about 50 law - school graduates a year .
jordan schwartz , the firm ' s hiring partner , says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 u . s . law firms conducted by american lawyer magazine . the poll , which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated , ranked the firm last . "" it wasn ' t an accurate reflection of the firm , "" he says . "" but it was a wake - up call . ""
so , cwt created an "" associate task force "" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life . the mentoring program was one result .
hiring blitz
despite rising joblessness , a few employers are hiring in a big way .
ziprealty inc . , an online real - estate broker in richmond , calif . , recently announced plans to hire 1 , 000 real - estate agents within the next 18 months . it has about 135 agents , all of whom work from home .
"" we have large consumer demands right now , so we want to make sure we have great realtors , "" says scott kucirek , executive vice president of people and culture .
since august , ziprealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets , which include los angeles , phoenix , san diego and chicago . the company has three full - time recruiters sending e - mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort . its database contains 200 to 300 prospects .
the job , which usually pays only commission , offers some perks . the company will pay new agents $ 1 , 500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home . after that , pay will be entirely commission based . new hires also receive cellphone and car allowances .

in new filing , enron reports debt squeeze
by richard a . oppel jr . and floyd norris

the new york times
page 1 , column 2
c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash . it said that if any of a number of things went wrong , its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question .
in a delayed quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission , the company said that it would have to repay $ 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan .
enron has about $ 1 . 75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year . the report for the third quarter , which was filed five days late , says the company faces immediate demand for $ 3 . 9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further .
enron ' s independent auditors with the firm of arthur andersen have not been able to complete their review of enron ' s financial statements for the third quarter . andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of enron ' s books related to enron ' s disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $ 600 million in profits in the last five years . enron has said that it will restate statements that andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon .
yesterday , representative john d . dingell of michigan , the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee , called for an investigation into arthur andersen ' s handling of the enron audits . a spokesman for andersen could not be reached last night .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , has agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , its smaller crosstown rival in houston , and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of enron , which is now at the lowest investment - grade rating . any downgrades could lead to a collapse of enron ' s core energy trading business , analysts say , as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with enron entirely .
the dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year , and the disclosures yesterday indicate that enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then , particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed . enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next september .
enron is in talks to obtain $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions . in addition , executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year . enron is also set to receive a $ 1 billion infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , if the deal closes next year .
still , even after factoring in cash flow from enron ' s core energy - trading operations , enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - - meaning that enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities .
carol coale , an analyst for prudential securities in houston , said the new disclosures indicated that enron ' s troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed , even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with dynegy was announced .
' ' our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank , ' ' ms . coale said . ' ' but now it sounds like enron ' s problems were actually more inherent than perceived . ' '
enron ' s deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , but in trading since the deal was announced enron ' s share price has lagged dynegy ' s price , reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms .
in new york stock exchange trading yesterday , before the enron filing was released , enron rose 6 cents , to $ 9 . 06 , and dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 , to $ 43 . 60 . at those prices , the value of the dynegy offer is 29 . 2 percent above enron ' s share price , compared with a 20 . 6 percent difference when the deal was announced .
some debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares , but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further . and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - - currently $ 11 . 71 an enron share .
in after - hours trading yesterday , after the release of the enron filing , the share price slipped to $ 9 .
enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $ 500 million . yesterday ' s filing provided some additional details on enron ' s relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay , and it said that additional write - offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined . it said that because enron ' s stock value had fallen , one write - down could be $ 700 million .
the disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet .
but the collapse of enron ' s stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts .
' ' it is not possible to predict , ' ' enron warned investors , whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful . ' ' an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern . ' '

decision to locate conocophillips in houston enhances world ' s energy capital

houston ( ap ) - the decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of phillips petroleum co . and conoco inc . in houston , home of the smaller conoco , helps cement the city ' s status as the nation ' s energy capital .
"" houston already was the energy capital of the world . this just proves it , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university in dallas .
"" all the major players are in houston and houston can accommodate the employee growth base , "" he said . "" it is easier to conduct the business in the houston market because not only are all the major companies there , all the support is in houston as well . ""
the dlrs 15 . 6 billion deal announced sunday that would create the nation ' s third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for houston , even though the nation ' s two largest oil companies - irving - based exxonmobil and san francisco - based chevrontexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere , each has thousands of employees working in the nation ' s fourth - largest city .
it all began with the 1901 spindletop strike in southeast texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental united states ' vast oil resources lay beneath texas soil .
"" historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries , "" said david bole , the vice president of randall & dewey , inc . , a houston - based oil consulting firm . "" but certainly with high - speed communications developed over the last 30 years , the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers .
"" what has set houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters , their vision and their ability to build mega - companies . in many cases it is their legacy that has built houston into today ' s oil capital . ""
shell oil co . is based in houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling , oil field services , pipeline , oil field firefighting and related companies .
in recent years , the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as dynegy , inc . , enron corp . , reliant inc . and others . together , they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city .
"" consolidation is cumulative - a self - fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place , "" bill gilmer , an economist in houston for the federal reserve bank of dallas , wrote in a recent publication . "" the same principles , of course , are what draw moviemakers to hollywood , financial service providers to new york and automakers to detroit . ""
and , it seems , energy companies to houston .

chevrontexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $ 1 . 8 bn by march 2003 .
david o ' reilly , chief executive , told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $ 1 . 2 bn within six to nine months of the deal , which was completed last month .
mr o ' reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2 . 5 to 3 per cent over the next five years , and dismissed worries about the falling oil price .
"" our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don ' t want to be in this business , "" he told reporters after addressing analysts in new york .
mr o ' reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $ 35 bn deal between conoco and phillips petroleum - only made him more confident that the chevrontexaco deal was right .
chevrontexaco now claims to be the third - largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth - largest in global oil and natural gas production . he said the synergies translated into gains of about $ 1 per share after tax .
chevrontexaco has an important role in dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron , the rival energy group . chevrontexaco has a 26 per cent stake in dynegy and immediately invested $ 1 . 5 bn in convertible preferred shares of dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in enron . chevrontexaco is committed to buying a further $ 1 bn of dynegy common stock once dynegy completes its takeover . if the deal fails ,",,,,,,,,,

houston ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with u . s . securities and exchange commission .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $ 690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week . that marked the start of a nine - day period that expires on nov . 26 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if not ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share . the move reflects adjustments made after the quarter ' s end ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on oct . 16 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $ 3 . 9 billion to other partnerships ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and """" would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron had released those figures earlier ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
credit could be a killer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to """" baa 3 """" and """" bbb - minus ",,,,," """" a junk rating .",,,,,,,,,
in nearly all of its partnership deals ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"me to call """" intellectual capital . """" he loved being smart ",,,,, souped - up path to american success : he joined manhattan ' s mckinsey and company as a business consultant ,,,,,,,,,
it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless ,,,,, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers . enron would not be a broker but a banker . it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved . and enron would make money on transactions ,,,,,,,,,
"skilling worked up some numbers and found them """" absolutely compelling . """" then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 enron executives . he had a one - page presentation . """" almost to a person ",,,,," """" let ' s go . """"",,,,,,,,,
the gas bank was not an overnight success . for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat ,,,,, and even if he is typically immodest ," """" we were in . """" and he was in too : in 1990 skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation ", a new division created just for him . in 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $ 11 million in profit . after that , says skilling ," """" we never looked back . """"",,,,,
skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn ' t work unless it had a trading component . myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go . but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas ,,,,, in turn , but with startling accuracy , thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined .,,,,,,,
this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made : he created ,,,,, cautious ," of course - the kind of people you ' d expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government . but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era : that included anyone who wanted to make money - lots of money - for themselves and for the company . """" enron was going to create a niche for itself or die "," """" one former executive explains . """" the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out ", because if they had narrow views about other things ," they had narrow views about the market . """"",,,,,
skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people . he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard ,,,,, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks ,,,,,,,,,
"you could see what he was looking for on """" super saturdays """" at the houston headquarters : eight fifty - minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between - the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day . they were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts ",,,,, knowing enron would come back with more . the starting salary was around $ 80 , was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown . ( enron people didn ' t live in far - flung suburbs . suburbs were uncool and too far from the office . ),,,,,,,,
for the lucky winners ,,,,, shining shoes , they could join enron ' s wellness program . massages were offered six days a week ," from seven in the morning until ten at night . """" they were so cutting edge "," """" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time . """" they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going . """"",,,,,,
skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms - analysts ,,,,," enron offered competitive salaries and merit - based bonuses - with no cap . """" if you really worked hard and delivered results ", as the saying goes , you got to eat what you killed . gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $ 1 million bonus . and the more you produced , the closer you got to jeff : real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia , land cruiser racing in australia , or off - road motorcycling in a re - creation of the baja 1 , 000 race ," ending at a spectacular mexican villa . """" every time he ' d speak ", i ' d believe everything he ' d say ," """" one loyalist says ."
and why not ? by 1995 enron had become north america ' s largest natural - gas merchant ,,,,, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents ( who ,,,,,,,,,
but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling . in 1997 ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company . by then ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 firing up an idea machine ; enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within ,,,,, and enron , enron was trading coal , paper , steel , and even weather . no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client . people drank more in warm weather than cold , so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn ?,,,,
but most exciting to the financial world was enron ' s entry into high - tech communications . because of the company ' s marketing dominance ,,,,, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price . then there was the broadband business : to enron , shedding hard assets , and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market ," """" businessweek insisted .",,,,,,
there was ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable : gains were maximized by creating ,,,,, enron could set the terms of its deals ,,,,,,,,,
"while many businesses used what was known in the industry as """" mark - to - market accounting ",,,,," they went on the books in the current year . if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called """" subjective accounting ", a literacy group , called on enron for a contribution ," it was suggested that he start raising money for enron ' s competing literacy charity : """" even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron "," """" he says .",,,,,
as enron became more and more successful ,,,,," quick . """" enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday ",,,,,,,,,
and ,,,,, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country . employees were rated on a scale of one to five , never that valuable in a trading culture , went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus . if protocol required an enron higher - up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world , he might help - or he might not , depending on whether another , potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere .,,,,
"everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed : """" they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in such a hothouse ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before jeff skilling could transform enron from the world ' s leading energy company into the world ' s leading company ,,,,, power plants - they may have been enron ' s pride ," """" an enron executive says of wall street ' s mood . """" it was the technology era . """"",,,,,,,,
to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past ,,,,, aggressive - her nickname was mark the shark - she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba . mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international ,,,,,,,,,
but then mark ran into trouble with a gas - fired power plant in dabhol ,,,,, and skilling ' s impatience with mark grew .,,,,,,,,,
forcing mark out ,,,,, but she remained . the truth was enron didn ' t mind firing lower - level employees , but failing to include him in the glamour deals , or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title . ( one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school , gratis . ) a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public - relations disaster . so lay and skilling did something classically enronian : they gave mark her own company . despite skilling ' s contempt for asset - heavy businesses , enron spent more than $ 2 billion to buy a run - of - the - mill british water utility that could serve as enron ' s entry into the emerging world of water privatization . mark was put in charge of making enron , yes , the world ' s greatest water company . azurix , as the new business was called , looked like another sure thing : its ipo in 1999 raised $ 695 million .,
but mark had to succeed on enron ' s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities . water is not like gas or electricity - owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up ,,,,, which had started out at $ 19 ," was folded into enron . """" i think it ' s best for rebecca to start afresh "," """" lay ", who had been a mentor to mark , told the wall street journal . or as one critic put it ," """" they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business . """"",,,,
as 2000 drew to a close ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost immediately the trouble started . enron ' s domination of the electric - power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle . both pbs ' s frontline and the new york times took on enron ,,,,, to say the least ,,,,,,,,,
within enron ,,,,," """" says mark palmer "," he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic . ( """" at least the titanic went down with its lights on . """" )",,,,,,,,
but the biggest problem was enron ' s telecommunications division ,,,,, enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street .,,,,,,,,,
skilling launched a campaign to keep enron ' s most important cheerleaders ,,,,," he called an analyst who challenged enron ' s financial reporting an """" asshole . """" when the company reported hefty second quarter profits "," that innovations were just around the corner . """" there wasn ' t any positive news "," """" carol coale ", of prudential financial ," says now . """" basically "," he talked me out of a downgrade . """"",,,,
the business press ,,,,, so institutionally unforgiving ," all these issues carry more weight . """"",,,,,,,,
this fact was not lost on people inside the company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loyalty had never been prized at enron ,,,,," """" if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn ' t have loyalty and has money ",,,,,,,,,
as it turned out ,,,,, he had an epiphany : life was short ; for him , arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors , and promised a kinder , gentler enron in the future . trading anything and everything was out . the company , lay says ," will still innovate but """" innovate much closer to our core . """" as for the culture : """" things like the performance review committee ", i think we could have applied better . by trying to categorize people into so many different categories ," you ended up creating a morale problem . """"",,
that skilling ' s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence . despite skilling ' s lengthy tenure with enron ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but on the day we meet ,,,,," """" ninety percent of my net worth is in enron . were my interests aligned with the shareholders ? absolutely . """"",,,,,,,,,

enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) held a special conference call tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the ceo publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off - balance sheet transaction .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that enron entered into with a partnership called ljm 2 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction . the company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when a share count drops ,,,,, assuming constant earnings .,,,,,,,,,
when asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now ,,,,, meaning a fourth - quarter reduction might not change matters that much . alternatively ,,,,,,,,,
calls to enron weren ' t immediately returned . the stock edged up 2 % tuesday after falling nearly 40 % since last week amid worries about complex off - balance sheet deals .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the call ,,,,, against which enron borrowed some $ 3 . 4 billion . lay became testy after questioning by richard grubman of boston - based hedge fund highfields capital management . grubman ,,,,,,,,,
grubman ' s line of questioning implied that the marlin assets were worth only about $ 100 million ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lay disputed the $ 100 million number . at one point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

world trade organization chief mike moore says the 142 - country body will go ahead with a key conference in qatar from nov . 9 - 13 that he hopes will give a major boost to the ailing global economy .
the announcement at a news briefing yesterday in doha , qatar , ended weeks of uncertainty over the meeting ' s venue , which had been thrown into question by security fears , mounting international concern over terrorism and a surge of anti - western feeling in muslim countries since the start of u . s . attacks on afghanistan .
"" if something seismic or catastrophic happens , we will reconsider , but we are planning to come here in just over two weeks ' time , "" moore said .
the focus of the conference will be efforts to launch a new round of negotiations among all member countries to remove many of the remaining barriers to free global trade .

enron information sought
houston - based energy - trading giant enron corp . says the u . s . securities and exchange commission has sought information on company transactions with limited partnerships that were managed by an enron senior officer .

the transactions to "" hedge certain merchant investments and other assets "" took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to enron ' s 2000 annual report , and resulted in a $ 16 million ( u . s . ) pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a $ 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships .
upset investors sent shares of enron down $ 5 . 40 more than 20 per cent to close at $ 20 . 65 in heavy trading in new york .

brown said yesterday he has "" anecdotal evidence "" that airlines are flying the company ' s 50 - seat jets more often and on more routes because the planes are more efficient than large planes to fly when traffic is light .
the trend has not brought new sales , brown said , but has helped firm up orders for the aircraft that typically take up to more than a year from the date of purchase to delivery .

houston - - shares of enron corp . plunged monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information about the company ' s transactions with limited partnerships , which were managed by an enron senior officer .
in a statement , enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week .
"" we welcome this request , "" enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said monday . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down $ 5 . 40 to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange .
the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a $ 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a $ 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identify the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .
"" enron entered into transactions with [ limited partnerships ] to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , "" according to the section .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an "" informal inquiry . ""
"" this is not an investigation , "" he said . "" we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us . ""
sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings .
the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved them , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .

enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day

enron keeps analysts happy as investors flee : call of the day
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - over lunch in a conference
room at boston ' s four seasons hotel last thursday , enron corp .
chairman kenneth lay tried to convince analysts and investors that
the company has no more surprises .
with the analysts , he apparently succeeded . enron remains one
of wall street ' s most highly rated stocks , even after the largest
energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run
by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $ 1 . 2 billion
in shareholder equity .
lay wasn ' t so successful with investors , who have abandoned
enron shares , slashing their value 42 percent in a week .
` ` you ' ve got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has
no clothes , ' ' said richard gross of lehman brothers inc . , who
today repeated his ` ` strong buy ' ' rating on enron . analysts at
credit suisse first boston , goldman , sachs & co . and other firms
have also kept their highest ratings on enron .
gross still likes the look of enron ' s finery . ` ` the core
franchise here is very valuable , ' ' he said , and the stock ' s
decline more than reflects the ` ` worst case ' ' for the company .
in boston and at similar meetings in houston and new york ,
lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships . he and other
enron executives assured investors the company has no more
surprises in store , according to greg phelps , who manages $ 1 . 1
billion at john hancock advisers inc . , and attended the boston
session .
the partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity
funds , according to analysts and investors , and included
investments that lost money . the securities and exchange
commission has asked for more information about them , enron said
yesterday .
one hold , one sell
while two analysts have cut their enron ratings after
learning about the partnerships , they only dented the company ' s
popularity on wall street .
michael heim of a . g . edwards & sons inc . in st . louis lowered
his rating to ` ` hold ' ' from ` ` buy ' ' on friday . he said he has been
looking for discussion of the partnerships in enron ' s sec filings
and is only seeing ` ` vague references ' ' that don ' t leave him with
a ` ` good comfort level . ' '
with heim ' s rating change , enron went from being the second
most highly rated stock in the standard & poor ' s 500 index to the
10 th , according to thomson financial / first call .
today , zach wagner at edward jones & co . in st . louis cut
enron to ` ` reduce ' ' from ` ` accumulate . ' ' ratings by edward jones ,
which caters to individual investors rather than institutions ,
aren ' t tracked by first call .
first call translates analyst ratings into numbers , with
` ` strong buy ' ' a one , ` ` buy ' ' a two , and so on , then averages the
ratings to rank a company ' s wall street popularity . the most
highly rated stock is tyco international ltd . , which has fallen 12
percent this year .
enron shares fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 today .
remaining skeptical
however highly brokerage analysts rate the stock , ` ` i have to
remain skeptical , ' ' said barry borak , energy analyst at david l .
babson & co . , which manages $ 60 billion in cambridge ,
massachusetts .
` ` there ' s been a huge loss of management credibility at
enron , ' ' borak said , because of the partnerships and the
unexpected departure in august of jeffrey skilling , who had held
the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir
apparent to lay . ` ` nobody i ' ve talked to thinks ( skilling ' s
departure ) is for personal reasons , ' ' borak said .
skilling helped transform enron from a gas pipeline company
into the biggest energy trading company . enron also owns power
plants in deregulated markets .
borak said babson doesn ' t own enron shares and won ' t be a
buyer ` ` until i can get better , more thorough information about
what else might pop up in the future . ' '
borak and other investors said enron has a reputation for not
providing enough information about its businesses , and they said
this makes the positive view of the company on wall street more
difficult to understand .
after skilling resigned , lay said the company would be more
open about its businesses . a bullet point in his talk in boston
was ` ` increased transparency of financial and operating results , ' '
according to a handout provided at the boston meeting .
amazed , dismayed
prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale wrote in a
note to clients last week that she was ` ` amazed at the willingness
of enron ' s management to break out earnings and expenses to the
degree that it disclosed in the third quarter . ' '
coale also wrote that she was ` ` dismayed by the apparent
` disguise ' of the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity hit that was not
disclosed in ( enron ' s ) press release and was briefly mentioned in
the earnings conference call . ' ' coale kept her rating on enron at
` ` buy . ' '
phelps at john hancock said that his ` ` cynical side ' '
believes that investment banking business has helped keep wall
street recommending enron stock . ` ` they provide some good
underwriting business , ' ' he said .
credit suisse first boston managed a secondary sale of 12
million enron shares in 1999 , with lehman brothers acting
as co - manager . credit suisse has also managed bond sales for
enron this year .
enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )

enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )
( updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph . )
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest
energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million
loan , ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from
money markets , say people familiar with the matter .
enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the securities and exchange commission was investigating its
finances . the company depends on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or
short - term debt , program to finance day - to - day operations .
moody ' s investors service last week placed all $ 13 billion of
the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade . any drop in the rating may cut off enron from the
commercial paper market , raising the costs of short - term debt .
` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief
financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today .
he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines ,
giving it enough cash to operate normally .
dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit ,
declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , also
wouldn ' t comment .
shares of enron , based in houston , fell 86 cents to $ 19 . 79 .
they have fallen 76 percent this year .
complex financing
an investor sued enron last week , saying dealings with two
partnerships run by fastow , ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment ,
cost the company $ 35 million . the suit also calls fastow ' s
leadership of the partnerships , set up to remove debt from enron ' s
books , a conflict of interest .
enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in
some partnerships run by fastow , said chief executive officer ken
lay on the conference call with investors today .
the number of shares differs from a wall street journal
report on thursday that said enron had bought back 55 million
shares . the buyback reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion ,
the journal said .
the company set up the partnerships and other affiliated
companies to buy enron assets such as power plants . the
partnerships allow enron to take debt off its books , letting it
borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading ,
enron said . enron trades electricity , natural gas , oil , coal and
other commodities .
` ` ` they have complex off - balance sheet financing , ' ' said
commerzbank analyst andre mead . ` ` it ' s difficult to ascertain the
full impact on shareholders . ' '
the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by fastow . the company has at least $ 3 billion in
such ` ` off - the - books ' ' financing in affiliated companies , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors .
depends on asset sales
one partnership , whitewing management , owns 250 , 000 preferred
shares that enron may have to convert to common stock . whitewing
partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if enron
common stock falls below a certain price or if enron ' s credit
rating drops under investment grade .
whitewing and other enron partnerships and trusts include
company executives as officers and directors , according to records
from the texas secretary of state .
` ` over the life of these trust structures , enron has in fact
issued a sizable amount of equity , ' ' enron treasurer ben gilsan
said . most of that was shares issued to enron executives as part
of a deferred compensation plan , gilsan said .
the whitewing partnership was financed with $ 1 . 4 billion in
bonds sold last year . the partnership used some of the proceeds to
buy enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling
them , officials said on the conference call . other company
partnerships operate with the same strategy .
` ` some investors are worried the asset sales won ' t cover the
full amount ( borrowed ) , and enron will have to furnish support to
the detriment of shareholders , ' ' said commerzbank analyst meade .
commercial paper rates
enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until
oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade .
based on bloomberg composite ratings , most of enron ' s long -
term debt is rated at bbb 2 and bbbl , two or three levels above
investment grade . fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s rate the
company ' s debt at investment grade .
enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and
advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the
company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas -
fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along
with j . p . morgan chase asian , middle eastern , european , african , as well as american - born . they are young , mostly under 35 , and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry - the guys wear khakis , polo shirts , and banana republic button - downs . almost preposterously fit , they move through the building intently , like winners . enron is nothing if not energetic : a big brother - size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators , while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage . a sculpture of the corporate symbol , an e tipped at a jaunty angle , radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis ; a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated . multicolored , inspirational flags hang from the ceiling , congratulating enron on its diversity and its values ; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron ' s simple if grandiose goal : "" from the world ' s leading energy company to . . . the world ' s leading company ! ""
for a while , that future seemed guaranteed , as enron transformed itself from a stodgy , troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000 . it was a wall street darling , with a stock price that increased 1 , 700 percent in that sixteen - year period , with revenues that increased from $ 40 billion to $ 100 billion . "" the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy , "" notes a 2001 report from global change associates , a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business .
this enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling , a visionary determined to transform american business . hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then - ceo ken lay , skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground , hauling it in pipelines , and then selling it to refineries and other customers . instead , it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms , from natural gas to electricity , from wind to water . if you had a risky drilling venture , enron would fund it for a piece of the action . if you wanted your megacorporation ' s energy needs analyzed and streamlined , enron could do the job . if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs , enron was there to build and build . basically , if an idea was new and potentially - and fantastically - lucrative , enron wanted the first crack . and with each success , enron became ever more certain of its destiny . the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high - tech world , and in february of this year , skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer . enron , says skilling , "" was a great marriage of the risk - taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk - taking mentality of the financial markets . ""
the enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century . like the high - tech companies it emulated , enron was going to reinvent the american business model and , in turn , the american economy . maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes : not just the old versus the new , but the best versus the mediocre , the risk takers versus the complacent - those who could see the future versus those who could not . the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital . with the best and the brightest , a company couldn ' t possibly go wrong .
or could it ? today enron ' s stock trades at around $ 35 , down from a high of $ 80 in january . the press cast enron as the archvillain of california ' s energy crisis last spring , and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market . a long - troubled power plant project in india threatened the company ' s global ambitions . telecommunications , in which enron was heavily invested , imploded . wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices . some of the change in enron ' s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business . but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame .
enron , jeff skilling says , had "" a totally different way of thinking about business - we got it . "" at enron , in fact , you either "" got it "" or you were gone - it was as simple as black and white . it is not coincidental , then , that the color scheme of skilling ' s river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed . here , the living room ' s white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors . black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets . billowy sofas set off the jet - black baby grand . in the entry , white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold , white marble . there is only one off - color note : after almost twenty years , jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron , having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo . once , skilling was hailed as the next jack welch ( general electric ' s masterful ceo ) , as one of worth magazine ' s best ceo ' s in america ( anointed in 2001 ) , and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which , a friend told businessweek , "" someone could actually get killed . "" today , he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning . "" i had no idea what i ' d let go of , "" skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron .
from a black chair in the white library , across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons , skilling clarifies . the demands of working 24 - 7 for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances . divorced , he lived in a 2 , 200 - square - foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher . he almost missed his brother ' s wedding . "" learning a foreign language - i never learned a foreign language ! "" he exclaims . he never once took his youngest son to school . "" i ' m interested in the kids . you don ' t do kids in fifteen - minute scheduling . "" travel : "" you can ' t go to africa for a week and get anything out of it ! "" skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities , then he stops and sighs . "" i ' m not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo ' s job , "" he says , finally . then his eyes lock on mine , and his voice , which had softened , regains its pragmatic edge . "" it would have been easy to stay , "" he says . "" but that would not have been good for me . ""
he ' s a smallish , ruddy - faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight , handsome in the way of corporate titans , with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze . but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull - witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation "" bizarre "" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time . his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button - down , and his matching blue eyes look put upon . "" i ' m surprised , "" he says , "" that people have so much trouble understanding this . ""
people who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn ' t help but notice a funny and , for its time , novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building . from nine to five and before and after , you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke . they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry , puffing like mad . they always looked hurried and furtive , even ashamed . whatever people knew about enron in those days ( and most people didn ' t know much ) , it was often associated with that scene : enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston , and there couldn ' t have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past . what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation ?
but this company was a child of another time , that period in the mid - eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business . federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady , secure industry , in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served , into a volatile free - for - all . the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business . so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company , houston natural gas ( hng ) found itself under attack from coastal corporation , oscar wyatt ' s less than gentlemanly firm . hng was then run by lay , a sturdy , taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy . ( his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war . ) lay , who was from missouri and never succumbed - at least outwardly - to texas brashness , had done well enough : thanks to canny expansions , hng ' s pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas .
hng fended off coastal , but to protect the company from other takeover attempts , lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in 1985 to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth , one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time . then , a funny thing happened : hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come - a lot like coastal . what the nebraskans blithely labeled "" the purchase "" was being called "" the merger "" back in houston , and before long , following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston , the company ' s center of gravity started shifting toward texas , and shortly after that , ken lay was running a new company called enron . "" over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future , "" says one person associated with enron at that time . "" he never fought change . he embraced change . ""
lay had won , but what exactly did that mean ? enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt , and thanks to deregulation , no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines . without new ideas - for that matter , a whole new business plan - the company could be finished before it really even got started .
like many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties , jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest , and he was self - made - at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start - up tv station in aurora , illinois . ( his mother would drop him off there every day after school . ) "" i liked being successful when i was working , and i was smart , "" he told businessweek earlier this year . but unlike many of his enron colleagues , skilling wasn ' t deliberate and soft - spoken and happy to go home at five o ' clock ; he was anxious and excitable , and nothing , but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call "" i",,,,,,,,,
"tellectual capital . """" he loved being smart ",,,,, souped - up path to american success : he joined manhattan ' s mckinsey and company as a business consultant ,,,,,,,,,
it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless ,,,,, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers . enron would not be a broker but a banker . it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved . and enron would make money on transactions ,,,,,,,,,
"skilling worked up some numbers and found them """" absolutely compelling . """" then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 enron executives . he had a one - page presentation . """" almost to a person ",,,,," """" let ' s go . """"",,,,,,,,,
the gas bank was not an overnight success . for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat ,,,,, and even if he is typically immodest ," """" we were in . """" and he was in too : in 1990 skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation ", a new division created just for him . in 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $ 11 million in profit . after that , says skilling ," """" we never looked back . """"",,,,,
skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn ' t work unless it had a trading component . myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go . but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas ,,,,, in turn , but with startling accuracy , thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined .,,,,,,,
this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made : he created ,,,,, cautious ," of course - the kind of people you ' d expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government . but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era : that included anyone who wanted to make money - lots of money - for themselves and for the company . """" enron was going to create a niche for itself or die "," """" one former executive explains . """" the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out ", because if they had narrow views about other things ," they had narrow views about the market . """"",,,,,
skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people . he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard ,,,,, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks ,,,,,,,,,
"you could see what he was looking for on """" super saturdays """" at the houston headquarters : eight fifty - minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between - the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day . they were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts ",,,,, knowing enron would come back with more . the starting salary was around $ 80 , was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown . ( enron people didn ' t live in far - flung suburbs . suburbs were uncool and too far from the office . ),,,,,,,,
for the lucky winners ,,,,, shining shoes , they could join enron ' s wellness program . massages were offered six days a week ," from seven in the morning until ten at night . """" they were so cutting edge "," """" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time . """" they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going . """"",,,,,,
skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms - analysts ,,,,," enron offered competitive salaries and merit - based bonuses - with no cap . """" if you really worked hard and delivered results ", as the saying goes , you got to eat what you killed . gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $ 1 million bonus . and the more you produced , the closer you got to jeff : real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia , land cruiser racing in australia , or off - road motorcycling in a re - creation of the baja 1 , 000 race ," ending at a spectacular mexican villa . """" every time he ' d speak ", i ' d believe everything he ' d say ," """" one loyalist says ."
and why not ? by 1995 enron had become north america ' s largest natural - gas merchant ,,,,, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents ( who ,,,,,,,,,
but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling . in 1997 ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company . by then ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 firing up an idea machine ; enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within ,,,,, and enron , enron was trading coal , paper , steel , and even weather . no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client . people drank more in warm weather than cold , so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn ?,,,,
but most exciting to the financial world was enron ' s entry into high - tech communications . because of the company ' s marketing dominance ,,,,, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price . then there was the broadband business : to enron , shedding hard assets , and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market ," """" businessweek insisted .",,,,,,
there was ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable : gains were maximized by creating ,,,,, enron could set the terms of its deals ,,,,,,,,,

as enron became more and more successful ,,,,," quick . """" enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday ",,,,,,,,,
and ,,,,, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country . employees were rated on a scale of one to five , never that valuable in a trading culture , went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus . if protocol required an enron higher - up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world , he might help - or he might not , depending on whether another , potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere .,,,,
"everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed : """" they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in such a hothouse ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past ,,,,, aggressive - her nickname was mark the shark - she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba . mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international ,,,,,,,,,
but then mark ran into trouble with a gas - fired power plant in dabhol ,,,,, and skilling ' s impatience with mark grew .,,,,,,,,,
forcing mark out ,,,,, but she remained . the truth was enron didn ' t mind firing lower - level employees , but failing to include him in the glamour deals , or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title . ( one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school , gratis . ) a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public - relations disaster . so lay and skilling did something classically enronian : they gave mark her own company . despite skilling ' s contempt for asset - heavy businesses , enron spent more than $ 2 billion to buy a run - of - the - mill british water utility that could serve as enron ' s entry into the emerging world of water privatization . mark was put in charge of making enron , yes , the world ' s greatest water company . azurix , as the new business was called , looked like another sure thing : its ipo in 1999 raised $ 695 million .,
but mark had to succeed on enron ' s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities . water is not like gas or electricity - owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up ,,,,, which had started out at $ 19 ," was folded into enron . """" i think it ' s best for rebecca to start afresh "," """" lay ", who had been a mentor to mark , told the wall street journal . or as one critic put it ," """" they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business . """"",,,,
as 2000 drew to a close ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost immediately the trouble started . enron ' s domination of the electric - power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle . both pbs ' s frontline and the new york times took on enron ,,,,, to say the least ,,,,,,,,,
within enron ,,,,," """" says mark palmer "," he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic . ( """" at least the titanic went down with its lights on . """" )",,,,,,,,
but the biggest problem was enron ' s telecommunications division ,,,,, enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street .,,,,,,,,,
skilling launched a campaign to keep enron ' s most important cheerleaders ,,,,," he called an analyst who challenged enron ' s financial reporting an """" asshole . """" when the company reported hefty second quarter profits "," that innovations were just around the corner . """" there wasn ' t any positive news "," """" carol coale ", of prudential financial ," says now . """" basically "," he talked me out of a downgrade . """"",,,,
the business press ,,,,, so institutionally unforgiving ," all these issues carry more weight . """"",,,,,,,,
this fact was not lost on people inside the company ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loyalty had never been prized at enron ,,,,," """" if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn ' t have loyalty and has money ",,,,,,,,,
as it turned out ,,,,, he had an epiphany : life was short ; for him , arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors , and promised a kinder , gentler enron in the future . trading anything and everything was out . the company , lay says ," will still innovate but """" innovate much closer to our core . """" as for the culture : """" things like the performance review committee ", i think we could have applied better . by trying to categorize people into so many different categories ," you ended up creating a morale problem . """"",,
that skilling ' s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence . despite skilling ' s lengthy tenure with enron ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but on the day we meet ,,,,," """" ninety percent of my net worth is in enron . were my interests aligned with the shareholders ? absolutely . """"",,,,,,,,,
free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures ,,,,, he promises ,,,,,,,,,

enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) held a special conference call tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the ceo publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off - balance sheet transaction .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that enron entered into with a partnership called ljm 2 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction . the company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when a share count drops ,,,,, assuming constant earnings .,,,,,,,,,
when asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now ,,,,, meaning a fourth - quarter reduction might not change matters that much . alternatively ,,,,,,,,,
calls to enron weren ' t immediately returned . the stock edged up 2 % tuesday after falling nearly 40 % since last week amid worries about complex off - balance sheet deals .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the call ,,,,, against which enron borrowed some $ 3 . 4 billion . lay became testy after questioning by richard grubman of boston - based hedge fund highfields capital management . grubman ,,,,,,,,,
grubman ' s line of questioning implied that the marlin assets were worth only about $ 100 million ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lay disputed the $ 100 million number . at one point ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grubman didn ' t immediately return a call seeking comment .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if enron has to find $ 900 million ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if enron ' s debt - to - capital ratio exceeds 65 % ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more static for enron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

new york - enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enron ( nyse : ene ) last week reported a third - quarter loss of $ 638 million after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . the market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $ 35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by fastow . enron shares ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the wall street journal online
stocks rallied sharply monday despite the widening anthrax scare , as a batch of better - than - expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors .
the dow jones industrial average gained 172 . 92 , or 1 . 9 % , to close at 9377 . 03 after gaining 40 . 89 points friday . the nasdaq composite index rose 36 . 75 , or 2 . 2 % , to 1708 . 06 after climbing 18 . 59 points in the previous session .
other major stock indexes gained ground monday . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index added 16 . 42 to 1089 . 90 , the new york stock exchange composite index rose 7 . 13 to 561 . 45 , and the russell 2000 index gained 4 . 80 to 430 . 50 .
bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened .
the stock market ' s gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in washington , d . c . , was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation . additionally , two other postal workers in washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment .
but stocks took the anthrax reports in stride , suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants , some analysts said monday . "" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray .
upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift .
investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt .
the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said . "" i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . ""
although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . "" the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , "" said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added .
still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued .
third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates .
the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates .
the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call .
shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 .
chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor .
u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 .
investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts .
but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 .
meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be "" difficult . ""
companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching . ""
one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 .
overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower .
in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks .
the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading .
in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein .
the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown .
in major u . s . market action :
stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands .
bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % .
the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday .

usa : update 3 - sec looks into enron deals , stock slides 20 pct .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 22 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 percent on monday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august .
a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating . the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry .
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took $ 1 . 01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments .
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months at the helm .
enron shares declined $ 5 . 49 , or 21 percent , to $ 20 . 56 in monday afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange , shaving off almost $ 4 . 2 billion of its market capitalization . the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 percent on monday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 .
shares declined 23 percent last week after the journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on wednesday .
enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into "" certain related party transactions "" involved the partnerships .
"" related party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments .
the journal reported $ 35 million of its third - quarter loss of $ 638 million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .
"" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , "" launer said .
some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .
"" this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .
"" it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one . ""
shares in the company are down 75 percent this year .

houston ( ap ) - shares of enron corp . plunged more than 20 percent monday after the energy trading giant said the securities and exchange commission had sought information company ' s transactions with limited partnerships , which were managed by an enron senior officer .
in a statement , enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week .
"" we welcome this request , "" enron chairman and chief executive officer kenneth l . lay said in a statement monday . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
investors were upset by the news , however , sending shares of enron down dlrs 5 . 30 to dlrs 20 . 75 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange .
the transactions took place in 1999 and 2000 , according to houston - based enron ' s 2000 annual report . they resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre - tax gain to enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000 .
enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships , instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions .
"" enron entered into transactions with ( limited partnerships ) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , "" according to the section in the annual report .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the sec first contacted enron last week and described the request is an "" informal inquiry . ""
"" this is not an investigation , "" he said . "" we see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us . ""
sec spokesman john heine said he could not comment on the filings . "" we can ' t confirm or deny that type of activity , "" heine said .
the electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements , the company ' s board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements , and they were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .

new york ( afx ) - shares of enron corp were down sharply in late morning trade , after the securities and exchange commission requested the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions , prompting ag edwards to downgrade the stock to ' hold ' from ' buy ' , dealers said .
at 11 . 10 am , enron was down 4 . 29 usd , or 16 . 47 pct , at 21 . 76 . the djia was up 57 . 57 points at 9 , 261 . 68 , and the s & p 500 composite index was up 5 . 57 points at 1 , 079 . 05 .
in a statement this morning , enron confirmed that the sec had requested documents , and said it would "" cooperate fully "" with the commission .
however , the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the sec ' s request .
according to ag edwards analyst mike heim , enron "" significantly reduced "" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially - owned subsidiary formerly run by enron ' s chief financial officer .
"" this arrangement , which was not discussed in past sec filings , has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community .
"" in our opinion , the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days .
"" however , we can give no assurances that all the problems at enron have been fully disclosed , "" heim said .
in its statement this morning , enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related - party arrangements , adding that the board was "" fully informed of and approved these arrangements "" , which were disclosed in the company ' s sec filings .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" said chief executive kenneth lay .

enron shares slide as sec seeks information on deals with cfo ' s partnership

dow jones business news

houston - - shares of enron corp . slumped monday after the energy - trading concern said the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about "" certain related party transactions , "" including those between enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer .
enron promised to cooperate fully with the sec request and said in a prepared statement that it "" welcomes "" the request and looks forward to put "" any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
in 4 p . m . edt trading on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares fell $ 5 . 40 , or 21 % , to $ 20 . 65 .
last week the wall street journal reported that a limited partnership organized by andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , made millions in profits in transactions with the firm . the story cited information reported in an internal partnership document .
enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with ljm 2 co - investment lp , the limited partnership created by mr . fastow .
in addition , enron took a $ 1 . 01 billion charge in the third quarter , mostly connected with write - downs of bad investments , producing a loss of $ 618 million , or 84 cents a share . excluding charges , income was $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , in the quarter .
the charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were , until recently , by mr . fastow .
the company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $ 35 million and involve the early termination of "" certain structured finance arrangements . ""
the partnerships were set up two years ago , and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper , some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for enron ' s chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase enron assets , the journal reported .
the energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals , which were disclosed in sec filings .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" enron chairman and chief executive kenneth lay said on monday .
separately , an enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in texas court alleging enron ' s board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing mr . fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships .
a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that enron ' s board lost over $ 35 million by allowing mr . fastow to run these partnerships , which engaged in transactions with enron and presented a conflict of interest .
the suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought enron assets , permitting mr . fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company ' s financial condition to earn millions of dollars .

enron says sec asks about related - party transactions ( update 8 )
( adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $ 3 billion . )
houston , oct . 22 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s shares fell 21
percent after the houston - based company said the securities and
exchange commission requested information on partnerships run by
chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives .
enron , the largest energy trader , created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books . an investor sued enron ' s
board wednesday , saying two partnerships cost the company $ 35
million and fastow ' s leadership of them was a conflict of
interest .
investors today said they were concerned that enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he
may be have to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies
if enron ' s debt ratings fall too far .
` ` we need confidence their long - term credit rating won ' t go
below investment grade , ' ' said roger hamilton , an analyst at john
hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 enron shares .
enron reduced shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by fastow , ljm cayman and lmj 2 co - investment , the wall journal
reported last week .
dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors today .
enron shares fell $ 5 . 40 to $ 20 . 65 . they touched $ 19 . 67 during
the day ' s trading , the lowest level since jan . 15 , 1998 .
shares plunge
the stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber - optic
communications networks and a water company , and the resignation
of jeff skilling as ceo in august after seven months on the job .
while skilling said he resigned for personal reasons ,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems , including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies .
on tuesday , enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$ 618 million third - quarter loss , the result of writing off $ 1 . 01
billion in failed investments .
moody ' s investors service placed the company ' s debt on watch
for possible downgrade . the company ' s debt is rated at investment
grade by fitch , standard & poor ' s and moody ' s .
the company received a faxed request for information from the
sec on wednesday asking for information , spokesman mark palmer
said , and will respond ` ` as soon as possible . ' '
` ` we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest , ' ' lay , who is also enron ' s chairman , said in a statement .
dilution fears
enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects , based on filings with the texas
secretary of state . fastow and other enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies .
some have bought enron assets such as power plants , removing
the debt for those projects from enron ' s books . that allows enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses , standard & poor ' s debt
analyst todd shipman said .
enron brokers trades of electricity , natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural - gas
pipelines .
dismantling the affiliates would be costly . whitewing
management , an affiliated company that has bought 14 enron power
plants and lists fastow as managing director , holds 250 , 000
preferred shares of enron .
enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade , according to company filings .
that would dilute the value of common shareholders ' investment .
` ` the concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there ? ' ' shipman said . ` ` investors are worried they might have
to share their enron earnings with a lot more people than they
